# extensions/launch_world: the room left running and worked at, for the
# two faults a one-shot check cannot see -- a leak and a slow crash.
#
#   extensions/launch_world/soak.sh
#
# tier: long
#
# **Why the launcher and not a game**: this is the process a player
# leaves open while they decide what to play, and it is the first thing
# every run of buildat draws. A room that grows a megabyte a minute is a
# room nobody notices until the machine is out of memory, and every
# picture check here would still pass.
#
# What it does: boots the room and works it -- browsing, searching,
# opening and shutting bays, walking, digging, placing, the terminal,
# the pause dialog -- around a loop for MINUTES minutes (3 by default),
# reading the client's resident size every ten seconds.
#
# What it asserts: the client is alive at the end and never crashed, and
# its resident size after the first minute has not grown by more than
# GROW per cent (25 by default). The first minute is warmup: the
# textures, the meshes and the ornament are all generated at boot and
# the reflection probe renders its ninety frames after that.
#
# It keeps builtin/luanti/test/lib.sh's contract ([CI_RUNS] (1)): exit 0
# passed, 1 failed, 2 could not run, and a last line saying which.
