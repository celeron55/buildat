# [GLOW_MARK]: the glowing orb's mark across the usable band, both
# figures, at two distances, into local/options_for_LAUNCH_WORLD_glow/.
#
#   extensions/launch_world/glow_sheet.sh
#
# **A grid, not two rows**: an outline is thinner *and* the lightness
# lifts it, so an outlined mark at the light end may be nothing at all;
# only a grid says where the two meet.
#
#   across  the emissive fraction that survives under the mark --
#           0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04. The emissive is multiplied by 26,
#           so a masked pixel only comes out of saturation below about
#           0.04 and nothing above the band does anything.
#   down    the figure (the mask, then its outline) at the portrait
#           distance, then the same two at the room's own hop -- a mark
#           exists to be read across the room, and this round's own
#           earlier mistake was judging tiles at sheet size.
#
# Only the glowing orb is shot: chrome and white are settled and their
# mark does not go through this cut.
#
# No tier line: this makes a picture for a person to choose from, and
# decides nothing itself.
