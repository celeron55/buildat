"""[MARK_ONEBIT]: how a logo becomes one bit, as a sheet to pick from.

    extensions/launch_world/onebit_sheet.py

An orb's mark is one bit on three of the room's surfaces -- a hole in a
glowing orb's emission, a patch of a mirror that stops being metal, an
etch in a white sphere's roughness -- and how a *logo* becomes that bit
is the pick this sheet is for. No engine: the transforms are here, over
the logos this tree ships, and the sheet is a picture.

**The round is settled** (2026-09-24): the mark is the largest
per-channel colour difference to a drawn neighbour, above a threshold
searched for an ink share of MARK_INK, unioned with the alpha
silhouette. That is the first column, and the sheet is now a record of
why rather than a menu -- the columns beside it are the choices that
were made and the reasons they were made, so that each is not asked
again:

  lum auto    -- the same search over brightness: what colour buys.
  outline     -- one fixed threshold: a dirt cube as a bare hexagon,
                 which is why the threshold is searched.
  alpha       -- the cut-out, and the blob a coloured logo becomes.
  luminance   -- the polarity trap: the buildat logo is luminance 1
                 everywhere it is drawn, and vanishes.
  outline|dither -- tone bought with four times the ink; rejected as
                 noise with a shape around it at this size.

Rows are the logos, the first column is the original and each further
column is a method. **Judged at the size the sphere gives it**: the
mark is about 64 texels on an orb, so every method is applied to a
64-pixel version rather than to the original -- a logo that thresholds
well at 512 can be mush at 64.

**Polarity is the trap.** A logo may be white lines on transparency or
black ink on white, and a mark needs the *shape* to be the ink either
way. The buildat logo is luminance 1 everywhere it is drawn, which is
what made it vanish under a luminance threshold. Every method here says
how it decides, and a method that gets it backwards shows as an
inverted tile rather than as a quiet mistake.

    ContentDB icon's coloured corner markers against grey are exactly
    that, and a luminance gradient is blind to them by construction.

    **The largest single-channel difference**, over the four
    neighbours. It was drawn against CIE dE76 in Lab and five other
    metrics (`outline_cheap.png`) and agrees with Lab on every logo

    three subtractions rather than a colour space the room would have

    searched for an ink share rather than fixed, so a metric only has
    to rank edges in roughly the same order -- the search divides its
    absolute scale out. Luminance still could not, because it does not
    rank a coloured marker low, it scores it at zero.
