			-- back on itself the worm has to change row first, which
			-- is what makes a switchback instead of a wiggle.
			-- **Momentum, so the worm draws strokes and not a
			-- staircase.** Weighting the four directions the same way
			-- every step makes it alternate -- right, down, right,
			-- down -- which is a diagonal drawn in single cells and
			-- reads as a zigzag rather than as a carved line. Carrying
			-- the last direction and preferring it turns the same
			-- walk into runs that meet at right angles, which is what

			-- the tile; without it a worm with momentum happily runs
			-- up and down for ever.
			-- **A spiral is a worm that keeps turning the same way**
			-- and never takes the easy way back. Holding a hand --
			-- clockwise or widdershins -- and preferring the turn that
			-- matches it curls the walk into itself; the clearance
			-- rule stops the curl one cell short of closing, which is
