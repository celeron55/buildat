-- **The bounce has to be point lights.** A directional one does almost
-- nothing in here: the voxel shader gates the sun by the skylight
-- nibble, which is what keeps a cave out of the sun, and this room's
-- nibble is nought everywhere. Eight times the brightness moved the
-- wall by three levels. So the fill below is point lights with long
-- ranges and low strength, spread through the room, which is the only
-- lever a sealed voxel room has.
-- The first six lights are the orbs -- each sits inside its own sphere,
-- so what lights the room is the thing you can see lighting it. The last
-- four are fill: two low at the sides and two picking out the
-- foreground, which is what keeps the chrome from being a black ball
-- with one highlight.
-- **The room's light, as the wall's own reading has it**: cold, from a
-- big square opening overhead, and the orbs. Nothing else -- the fill
-- and the per-bay washes that lit the old flat wall are gone, because
-- they re-light the very surface the pocket's contrast line depends on.
--
-- **The whole shadow budget goes to the overhead light**, which is the
-- one doing the dramatic work on the wall's relief: without it the deep
-- insets cannot read black while lit. The orbs are plain point lights
-- with a tight range -- no cube shadow maps and no cones. The pocket's
-- own contrast line is free: the wall's outward face has the orb behind
-- its plane, so N dot L is negative there and it takes nothing, while
-- every face inside the pocket looks at the orb.
-- **The opening's own emitter**, filling the square cut through the
-- ceiling: unlit and far above 1, so it clips to white and a mirror
-- shows a sharp bright square where the light comes from. A light casts
-- nothing a reflection can see; only a surface does.

-- one, which reads bright -- and every bake after it was converging
-- that feedback. Ninety-one frames of it, then four spread over three
-- seconds, both of them a loop dressed as a wait.
--
-- So the rule is not when, it is **what the bake is allowed to see**:
-- the zone wears the black cube while the room is drawn into the probe,
-- which makes the first bake a room lit by its own lamps and nothing
-- else. That does not depend on a clock, a frame count or a machine's

-- reflects a red floor (user, 2026-09-26). So the cube goes on the zone
-- and the room is drawn into it **once more, the very next frame**: the
-- second bake is the room lit by the first, which is the bounce the red
-- floor was missing. Two frames, both inside the boot's own burst,

--   * all three together draw a black frame, and so does Tonemap alone
--     (mean 1 of 255), so it is not AutoExposure or BloomHDR
--   * Tonemap.xml is not missing its parameters -- it declares
--     TonemapExposureBias itself, so the "unset reads as zero" rule is
--     not the cause
--   * every command in it reads the texture named "viewport" and writes
--     it back, and this game's scene goes through
--     set_preferred_viewports(), which renders it to an offscreen
--     texture of its own. That is the first thing to suspect: the
--     effect is reading a viewport the scene was never drawn into.
-- The room is lit to fit in the range meanwhile, so the orbs clip to
-- white -- which is what a source should do -- and the wall stops short

-- **Built again on the way back from a game, not kept.** The cloned

-- global and putting it on a fresh Viewport handed Urho3D a freed
-- RenderPath, and the first frame after the game segfaulted in
