# [LAUNCH_WORLD]'s floor, an options round: the same standing frame with
# the floor's light squares at four values and two finishes, into
# local/options_for_LAUNCH_WORLD_floor/.
#
#   extensions/launch_world/floor_sheet.sh
#
# **Why the floor and not the lighting** (2026-09-24): reading the look
# against the reference frame at the new standing place, the median sits
# under the reference's and the 90th and the white share sit over it,
# and both are the floor -- its light squares are the brightest surface
# in the room and they clip near the camera. The sources are where they
# should be.
#
# The knobs are BUILDAT_LAUNCH_FLOOR_VALUE (the light square's value)
# and BUILDAT_LAUNCH_FLOOR_GLOSS (its roughness; lower is glossier), so
# trying one is a flag rather than an edit.
#
# Taken on an empty user path, since a sphere the player parked in front
# of the camera is worth several points of every number here.
#
# No tier line: this makes a picture for a person to choose from, and
# decides nothing itself.

# launch actions, no saves, no servers and no save read, so the wall is
# lit by the light from above and the orbs in their pockets rather than
# by a game somebody left standing on the floor.
#
# **And the probe that lets the finish matter**: with one mip level a
# rough surface reflects as sharply as a mirror, so the gloss knob moved
# the picture six tenths of a level and the round could not be judged
# (user, 2026-09-24). An eight-bit cube takes a mip chain -- the float16
# one blacks every primitive that reflects it, its own shader having no
# guard against what the levels hold -- so the finish is shot on that
# one. What it costs is the top of a source inside a reflection, which
# is [PBR_HDR]'s own trade and is the user's to make.

# **The two axes want two rooms** (user, 2026-09-24), so this is two
# sheets rather than a grid:
#
# - **The value axis** is about how bright the floor is against the
#   wall, and a game standing on the floor lights that wall from below
#   -- so it is shot **bare**, in the composition the reference frame
#   has, at one finish.
# - **The gloss axis** is about how crisply the floor returns *the
#   things standing on it*, and bare removes them all: what made
#   old1/refl.png read as a mirror at a glance was the torus and the
#   chrome spheres in it. So the finish is shot in the **populated**
#   room, at one value.

# the eight per cent the shader assumes; above 1 it is no longer a
# physical dielectric, which is why it is a pick.
