# [LAUNCH_WORLD] (4): **a native server's icon, kept from one connect**.
# A digger server with an admin's server_icon.png of 120 pixels, which it
# scales to 64; a client connects once and quits; the client is started
# again into the room, connecting to nothing, and the server's sphere on
# the floor wears the stored icon.
# [SERVER_ICONS]: **a Starport listing's icon on the floor**. A Starport
# and a Hearth listed on it with a 64-pixel icon; an announce with a
# larger one is refused; the room's first start fetches the list and the
# icon, and the second wears it on the listing's sphere. Luanti's
# servers wear the icon of the game the list names, where it is installed.
