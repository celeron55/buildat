-- The room does its attract mode and the menu is stacked over it: the
-- menu takes every input and the room is the view out of the window.
-- That serves the person who wants the menu's convenience *and* likes
-- what the room looks like, which is probably more people than either
-- pure case.
--
-- **It is nearly free, and this file is the proof**: the attract mode
-- exists, the menu is UI, `uistack` is what a screen over a scene
-- already is, and composing is one verb. What each of the two offers is
-- the whole API between them -- the room a passive backdrop, the menu
-- its own boot.
