-- What a node's surface is made of, guessed from its definition.
--
-- **Both Luanti clients read this one file** ([VOXEL_MATERIALS] in
-- doc/plan/rendering_plan.md): the extension with the definition its
-- nodedef.lua parsed off the wire, builtin/luanti with the definition the
-- game registered, through core.__voxel_defs() in its bootstrap.lua. The
-- two spell a drawtype differently -- a number on the wire, a name in a
-- mod -- and both spellings are taken below; what else is read (name,
-- groups, waving, light_source) is spelled the same on both sides.
--
-- The atlas derives a normal map and a spec map from six numbers per texture
-- segment (see src/interface/atlas.h), and the PBR voxel shader reads them.
-- Luanti says nothing about any of them: a node definition knows its drawtype,
-- its groups and whether it waves, and that is what there is to go on. So this
-- is a guess, and it is in a file of its own so that it can be argued with
-- without touching the world.
--
-- The numbers:
--   roughness      0 = mirror, 1 = chalk
--   spec_strength  how much light the surface returns at all
--   bumpiness      how much the texture's own luminance becomes relief
--   translucency   how much light comes through from behind
--   spots          animated sparkle: moving highlights, for water
--   static_spots   the same but standing still: facets in sand, snow, ore
--
-- The two spot fractions are how much of a surface is a spot at any one
-- moment, and they want to be small: a spot reflects at full strength
-- whatever the rest of the surface does, so a few per cent reads as a surface
-- catching the light and a tenth of it reads as glitter paint. These are
-- scaled to the numbers games/voxel_lighting arrived at, which is the same
-- shader with the same constants behind it: grass 0.012, leaves 0.03, water
-- 0.05, rock 0.04 standing still.
--
-- Not here: metalness. The spec map's four channels are full and cMetallic is
-- per material, so metal nodes read as very glossy dielectrics.
