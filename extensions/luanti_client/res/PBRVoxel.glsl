// Forked from builtin/voxel_shading's PBRVoxel.glsl, which a Luanti client
// cannot use: builtin/ is not on a client's resource path and there is no
// buildat server to deliver it. One change of its own, cSkyColor below; keep
// the two files in step when either is touched.
//
// Copied from CoreData/Shaders/GLSL/PBRLitSolid.glsl (Urho3D 1.7.1). Two
// changes, both about how voxel skylight reaches the ambient term:
//
//   VS  vVertexLight mixes the zone ambient with the vertex color instead of
//       being the zone ambient alone
//   PS  the vertex color is not multiplied into diffColor
//
// The mesher packs a voxel's lighting into the vertex color as
//   rgb = light bounced off nearby surfaces, already attenuated
//   a   = how much of the sky the surface sees
// so the ambient a surface receives is
//   cAmbientColor.rgb * color.a + color.rgb
// which is a real mix of two colors: sky blue where the sky is visible, and
// the neutral grey of bounced light where it is not. Ambient occlusion and a
// per-face brightness are already folded into both terms by the mesher.
//
// Direct light is deliberately left alone. The sun is shadow mapped, so
// attenuating it by skylight as well would darken shadowed faces twice.
//
// On top of that, two things the stock PBR shaders do differently:
//
//   VOXELNORMALMAP  the tangent frame is built from the derivatives of the
//       world position and the texture coordinate rather than from a vertex
//       attribute, because the voxel mesher writes no tangent -- the vertex's
//       tangent slot carries the surface modifiers instead, when there are any
//   VOXELIBL  reflections of the zone cube map, specular only. The diffuse
//       half of image based lighting is left out: the skylight in the vertex
//       color is already the scene's ambient diffuse, and adding an
//       unoccluded sky on top of it would light the inside of a cave. The
//       specular term is scaled by the same skylight for the same reason.
//       cSkyVis dims the cube map by direction: it is how much of the sky the
//       camera can see each way, as 6x6 values per cube face, which the client
//       fills by marching the voxel data. So a tunnel's walls stop reflecting
//       sky while the sky out of its mouth still reflects, and a cave seen
//       from outside reflects no horizon band it cannot see. There is no
//       separate indoor cube map: the same sky, dimmed where it is not
//       visible, is what a surface indoors reflects.
//   VOXELSPOTS  which parts of a surface are turned to catch the light at this
//       moment. Worked out per pixel from world position and time rather than
//       stored, so the specks come and go the way leaves in wind do, and a
//       surface with no animated normal map can still sparkle.
//   VOXELMODIFIERS  the voxel format's surface modifiers, which the mesher
//       wrote into the vertex tangent: an albedo tint, and wetness, grain and
//       gloss changing the albedo, the roughness and how much of the texture's
//       relief is kept. Off by default, because a world that binds no modifier
//       has nothing in the tangent; see PBRVoxelModifiers.xml.
//   VOXELTRANSLUCENCY  light reaching a surface from behind and coming through
//       it at those spots, tinted by the surface's own color. This is why a
//       leaf against the sun reads yellow-green and not as the blue of the sky
//       lighting its front.
//
// sSpecMap carries roughness in r, where Urho's own PBR shaders read it, and
// spec_strength, translucency and the spot fraction in gba. Metalness is not
// per texel here; nothing has been metal yet, so it stays cMetallic.
