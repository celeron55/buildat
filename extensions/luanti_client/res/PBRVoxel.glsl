// A fork of builtin/voxel_shading's PBRVoxel.glsl, and no longer a copy of it.
//
// It started as one because a Luanti client cannot use the built-in shader:
// builtin/ is not on a client's resource path and there is no buildat server
// to deliver it. What keeps the two apart now is that a good deal of what is
// in here is an art style rather than a mechanism -- how far a spot turns, how
// narrowly a leaf passes light through itself -- and this client's worlds and
// apps/voxel_lighting's are not the same worlds. Tuning one of them through a
// shared file retunes the other, which is how voxel_lighting's rock quietly
// lost its speckle.
//
// So the two are not kept in step. A fix to the machinery is worth carrying
// across by hand; a number that decides how something looks is not. What
// differs today, and why:
//
//   cSkyLight, cSkyTint, cSkyTintAmount
//                       VOXELSKYTINT only, which is builtin/luanti's own
//                       client: the brightness of the sky's contribution and
//                       a hue to move the cube map towards, in place of
//                       cSkyColor. See the uniforms below for why they are
//                       two knobs rather than one.
//   cSkyColor           Only here. The colour the sky is at this moment, which
//                       the client pushes so that reflections follow the sky
//                       it paints without a cube map being rebaked.
//   SPOT_TILT           0.06 here, 0.45 there. A Luanti game's ground is
//                       plants the whole way across and every one of them can
//                       hold a spot, so the sparkle has to gather tightly
//                       around the light or it reads as glitter over a field.
//                       voxel_lighting's few surfaces are sparsely spotted and
//                       a wide turn is what makes them catch anything at all.
//   spotGloss           Ramped on sharply here, linear there. With plants this
//                       dense, the half open cells -- most of them at any
//                       moment -- are a sheen that follows the light.
//
// STATIC_SPOT_TILT is the same number in both and wants to stay that way: a
// facet is a chip of rock either way, and narrowing it does not gather the
// speckle anywhere, it only takes it off the sand.
//
// Copied from CoreData/Shaders/GLSL/PBRLitSolid.glsl (Urho3D 1.7.1). Two
// changes, both about how voxel skylight reaches the ambient term:
//
//   VS  vVertexLight mixes the zone ambient with the vertex color instead of
//       being the zone ambient alone
//   PS  the vertex color is not multiplied into diffColor
//
// The mesher packs a voxel's lighting into the vertex color as
//   rgb = light bounced off nearby surfaces, already attenuated
//   a   = how much of the sky the surface sees
// so the ambient a surface receives is
//   cAmbientColor.rgb * color.a + color.rgb
// which is a real mix of two colors: sky blue where the sky is visible, and
// the neutral grey of bounced light where it is not. Ambient occlusion and a
// per-face brightness are already folded into both terms by the mesher.
//
// Direct light is deliberately left alone, unless VOXELSUNGATE is defined:
// with it, the directional light is multiplied by the vertex color's alpha, so
// that a world whose light value says "underground" gets no sun. That is for a
// world whose light curve is built for it -- see PBR_LIGHT_MAP in the Luanti
// client's world.lua; without such a curve it would darken shadowed faces
// twice, which is why it is off by default.
//
// On top of that, two things the stock PBR shaders do differently:
//
//   VOXELNORMALMAP  the tangent frame is built from the derivatives of the
//       world position and the texture coordinate rather than from a vertex
//       attribute, because the voxel mesher writes no tangent -- the vertex's
//       tangent slot carries the surface modifiers instead, when there are any
//   VOXELIBL  reflections of the zone cube map, specular only. The diffuse
//       half of image based lighting is left out: the skylight in the vertex
//       color is already the scene's ambient diffuse, and adding an
//       unoccluded sky on top of it would light the inside of a cave. The
//       specular term is scaled by the same skylight for the same reason.
//       cSkyVis dims the cube map by direction: it is how much of the sky the
//       camera can see each way, as 6x6 values per cube face, which the client
//       fills by marching the voxel data. So a tunnel's walls stop reflecting
//       sky while the sky out of its mouth still reflects, and a cave seen
//       from outside reflects no horizon band it cannot see. There is no
//       separate indoor cube map: the same sky, dimmed where it is not
//       visible, is what a surface indoors reflects.
//   VOXELSPOTS  which parts of a surface are turned to catch the light at this
//       moment. Worked out per pixel from world position and time rather than
//       stored, so the specks come and go the way leaves in wind do, and a
//       surface with no animated normal map can still sparkle.
//   VOXELMODIFIERS  the voxel format's surface modifiers, which the mesher
//       wrote into the vertex tangent: an albedo tint, and wetness, grain and
//       gloss changing the albedo, the roughness and how much of the texture's
//       relief is kept. Off by default, because a world that binds no modifier
//       has nothing in the tangent; see PBRVoxelModifiers.xml.
//   VOXELTRANSLUCENCY  light reaching a surface from behind and coming through
//       it at those spots, tinted by the surface's own color. This is why a
//       leaf against the sun reads yellow-green and not as the blue of the sky
//       lighting its front.
//
// sSpecMap carries roughness in r, where Urho's own PBR shaders read it, and
// spec_strength, translucency and the spot fraction in gba. Metalness is not
// per texel here; nothing has been metal yet, so it stays cMetallic.
