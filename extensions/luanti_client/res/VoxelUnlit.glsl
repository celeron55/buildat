// Voxel geometry lit by what the mesher baked into its vertex colors, and
// nothing else. Urho3D's CoreData/Shaders/GLSL/Unlit.glsl with the vertex
// color read the way interface/mesh.h says to read it:
//
//   ambient = cAmbientColor.rgb * vColor.a + vColor.rgb
//
// The alpha is how much of the sky the surface sees and the rgb is the light
// that reaches it regardless of the sky. cAmbientColor is the zone's ambient
// color, so a world moves the sun by setting that one color and no geometry
// is built again.
//
// Unlit because that is the whole point: the light is in the vertex colors,
// where ambient occlusion and a per-face brightness are already folded in.
// A dynamic light in the scene reaches this geometry through the additive
// light pass the technique beside this file adds, which is Urho3D's own
// LitSolid rather than anything here. The fancier alternative is
// builtin/voxel_shading's PBRVoxel,
// which reads the same vertex colors and adds normal maps, reflections and
// direct light on top of them.
//
// A texel below half alpha is discarded rather than blended, which is what
// makes a texture with holes in it -- leaves, a plant, a pane of glass --
// read as holes while staying in the opaque pass.
