// How much of the sky the camera can see, per direction, and the lookup that
// reads it. The client raymarches a cube of directions through the voxel
// data it already holds and uploads the result; see skyvis.lua in
// extensions/luanti_client and client_lua/module.lua in
// builtin/voxel_shading, which fill it, and [CAVE_SKY] in
// doc/plan/rendering_plan.md for what reads it.
//
// Included rather than copied because two shaders in this directory want it:
// PBRVoxel.glsl dims what a surface reflects, and LuantiSky.glsl dims the
// sky itself. **builtin/voxel_shading has its own copy of the same block**,
// for the nine games that draw with its shaders rather than these; that one
// is not shared, because a change there is checked against
// games/voxel_lighting's images and this file is not on that path.

    // How much of the sky the camera can see, per direction: a cube of
    // SKYVIS_CELLS squared values per face, 1 for full sky and 0 for none,
    // packed four to a vec4 in face, row, column order. The client writes them as one
    // buffer parameter, which Urho hands to a float array uniform; a cube map
    // texture would have to be built and uploaded per update instead.
    //
    // vec4 rather than a float array so the packing is the same whether or not
    // the driver lays uniforms out as std140, where an array of float or vec3
    // pads every element out to four.
    // Cells per cube face, per axis. Six faces of SKYVIS_CELLS squared values,
    // packed four to a vec4, so the array is 6*C*C/4 long -- keep the two in
    // step, and in step with CELLS in the client's module.lua, which fills
    // them.
