-- The player's box in the world: what the keys do to it, what stops it, and
-- what gravity does to it.
--
-- Luanti's player is an axis-aligned box 0.6 nodes across and 1.75 tall whose
-- bottom face is the position the server talks about. This knows nothing of
-- the protocol or of Urho3D: it asks whether the node at an integer
-- coordinate stops the player, which is what makes it checkable without
-- either of them (see test.lua).
--
-- Collisions are resolved one axis at a time, and only against the nodes the
-- box moves into. Resolving axis by axis is what makes sliding along a wall
-- work; looking only at the nodes ahead is what keeps a player who is already
-- inside a node -- the server put them there, or something was built on them
-- -- able to move out of it.
