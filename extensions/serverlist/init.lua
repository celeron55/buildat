-- **A fetched serverlist as launch actions** ([LAUNCH_WORLD] step 5's
-- last piece, [SERVER_LIST]). The launch grid is built at boot and a
-- fetch is not, so the rows a launcher file offers are **the last
-- fetch's**, kept in a file of this extension's own; asking for them
-- starts a fetch that rewrites it for the next boot.
--
-- **It changes nothing in `luanti_client`**, which is frozen: that
-- extension's `on_untrusted_launch` already takes an `address`, so a
-- launch action can hand it a server and it opens its connect dialog on
-- one. This is the source of the list and nothing else.
--
-- The fetch goes through `network.http_get`, which asks the user about
-- the host the first time as it does for a socket -- a launcher that
-- reached the network without asking would be the wrong kind of quiet.
