# A list of this check's own is served on a port of its own, so nothing

# is the whole path: the extension fetches and caches, the launcher file
# offers the cached rows as launch actions with the player count as
# their significance, and a launch UI draws them -- the room, which
# makes a server a mirror by category and stands its invented padding
# down when real ones are there.
#
# It keeps builtin/luanti/test/lib.sh's contract ([CI_RUNS] (1)): exit 0
# passed, 1 failed, 2 could not run, and a last line saying which.
