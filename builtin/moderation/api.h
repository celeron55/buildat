// **Moderation** ([MODERATION_MODULE], from Starport's [STARPORT] 5 to 7):
// reports, their groups and weights, the queue, a moderator's decision, the
// audit log, the statements of reasons and the appeals, for any app. It
// knows nothing of what is moderated: a subject is an id the app gives, and
// the app is a Host whose callbacks say what a subject is and do the
// actions. Everything is in the app's save, in its stores "reports",
// "groups", "audit", "statements" and "appeals", each record JSON:
// - A report: {id, listing (the subject), reason, text, key, address, ts,
//   trusted, weight, group, state (open, held, upheld, rejected), held,
//   outcome, decided_at, ...the app's}. Its weight is the app's to give.
// - A group, the open reports of one subject and reason: {id, listing,
//   reason, reports, state (open, closed), opened, note, weight, auto,
//   decided, decided_by, decided_at, ...the app's}. Its weight is the sum of
//   its open reports' weights, the largest one per Host::bucket.
// - A statement, to the subject's owner: {id, ts, listing, listing_name,
//   action, reason, text, by, owner, appeal}; an appeal of one: {id,
//   statement, listing, by, acted_by, text, ts, state, outcome,
//   decided_by, answer}. Another moderator than the one who acted decides.
// The field is "listing" for any subject, as Starport's saves have it.
//
// The module holds no state: every call names its Host. The Host's
// callbacks run in this module's thread while the app waits in access(),
// so a callback that audits or states is handed the Interface to call
// directly; calling access() from one would be this module accessing
// itself.
