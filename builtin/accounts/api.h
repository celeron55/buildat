// **The server's accounts** ([VANILLA_PUBLIC] 2, from the floorplanner's
// [FP_ACCESS]): who may join and as whom, and who is an admin, for every
// game on the server. A client joins through this module before its game
// lets it in:
// - The accounts are in the server's own save, "_server" (a game leaves
//   saves beginning with _ out of its lists), store "accounts".
// - A password is PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a salt of its own.
// - A server with no admin prints a setup code; the first to join with it
//   is the admin. A new account needs an invite from an admin, unless
//   registration is open, which it is by default only on a server the
//   launcher started. Open registration takes at most 5 untrusted
//   accounts made in 30 days from one network (below LV_MEMBER).
// - The launcher's own user of a server it started (launch parameter
//   launcher=1, from 127.0.0.1 or ::1) joins by name alone, and is the
//   first admin.
// - Failed logins wait, doubling, per address's network; every login is
//   logged. A kept login lasts 90 days from its last use.
// - An admin kicks, bans and unbans, and manages the accounts and invites;
//   a moderator (LV_MODERATOR) does the same in the Server window's
//   Accounts page, beside deleting an account, resetting a password,
//   adding one and the settings.
//
// The client's side is builtin/accounts/client_lua/accounts.lua: the join
// dialog, and the calls a game's admin pages make.
