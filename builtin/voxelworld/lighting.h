	// The top of the section region is the formal answer, and on a
	// Luanti-sized map that is thirty thousand voxels up and never loaded,
	// so it never fires: what lit a generated world was the mapgen writing
	// the light once and the flood keeping it. That leaves a re-flood with
	// no source of its own -- relight_if_stale() zeroes a section before it
	// re-floods it, and it could only get the daylight back from a
	// neighbouring section that still had some. A section zeroed while the
	// lit one above it was out of memory stayed dark for ever and was then
	// the dark neighbour for the next one relit beside it, which is a
	// played world going dark in patches ([UNDERGROUND_LIGHT], 2026-09-28:
	// a played VoxeLibre world read daylight 0 in open air thirty nodes
	// above its own canopy where the same seed generated afresh reads 15,
	// and core.fix_light() could not bring it back).
	//
	// So the top of the *data* answers too: a voxel at the top of its own
	// section whose column walks up through clear air and out of the loaded
	// world is under the open sky. That is Luanti's own rule -- its
	// propagateSunlight() takes the ignore above a chunk as sunlit -- and
	// the same one mesh.cpp's horizon_says() uses where a ray leaves the
	// volume ("walked out under the open sky").
	//
	// simplified: a cave section relit while the rock above it happens to
	// be out of memory reads as sky. The sections above a loaded one are
	// loaded too inside a load point's radius, so what this answers in
	// practice is the top of the loaded column; the principled version
	// wants the column's surface height, which voxelworld does not keep --
	// mesh.cpp's horizon map is where that lives.
	//
	// Only asked of a voxel at the top edge of its section, so the walk is
	// one column per section face rather than one per seed.
	// The lowest voxel in a column the sky still reaches: everything above
	// the highest thing that stops light, and the whole column where
	// nothing does. Walked from the top of the world down, a whole section
	// at a step where the section is not loaded -- there is no data there
	// and above the terrain that is sky.
	//
	// Cached per column for the run of one flood, because a relight seeds a
	// section's whole face and those seeds share their columns; cleared
	// wherever a flood begins, since a write can move a column's top.
