-- the whole state rather than about whatever has arrived so far -- which is
-- the ambiguity that three cycles of shooting were hedging against.
--
-- The reply carries the picture's name and nothing else. The fixture set the
-- state, so it is the one that knows which state this is, and because it
-- advances on the reply rather than on a clock there is never more than one
-- state in flight.
