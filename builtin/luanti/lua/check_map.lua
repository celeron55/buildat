-- The one runnable check the map seam leaves behind: a node written, flushed
-- into voxelworld by the module between the two halves, and read back out of
-- it. The write-behind buffer makes a round trip that never leaves the buffer
-- prove nothing, which is why this is two functions and not one.
--
-- Run once at the end of run_game(); see create_world() in luanti.cpp.

-- Everything here happens this high up, which is above what any mapgen
-- builds and below the map's own limit: a world with terrain in it is a
-- world where the check's own nodes are written into ground that a
-- generator is still filling in another thread, and a generated voxel wins
-- over an empty one -- so the air this writes would stop being air under
-- it. Up here what a generator produces is air, which is what the check
-- wants anyway.
--
-- simplified: a game whose mapgen builds at twenty thousand fails this the
-- way a game whose mapgen builds at two does today. The upgrade path is to
-- wait for the sections the check uses to be generated before writing into
-- them, which needs the check to span steps.
