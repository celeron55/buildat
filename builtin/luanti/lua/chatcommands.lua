-- What this tree adds to the chat commands the vendored builtin registers.
-- Loaded straight after vendor/builtin/init.lua, so the commands it changes
-- are already there; nothing under vendor/ is edited for it.

-- **/fixlight with a radius on its own** (user, 2026-09-28). Luanti's own
-- command takes `here [<radius>]` or two positions in parentheses, and what
-- a player wants when a patch of the world is dark is the ground they are
-- standing on: `/fixlight 64` is that radius, and `/fixlight` on its own is
-- 32. Anything else is Luanti's own parameter and is handed to it unread, so
-- `here`, `here 80` and `(x,y,z) (x,y,z)` all still work.
--
-- What wants it is [UNDERGROUND_LIGHT]: a world played before the relight
-- had a sky source of its own is dark in patches, and nothing re-marks those
-- sections, so this is how one is brought back.

-- **/grant and /revoke on a server's admin** ([SECURITY_RUN_1]): the
-- builtin reads the player's privileges, changes one and writes the lot
-- back -- and an admin's are every privilege there is (get_player_privs),
-- so a /grant of one wrote all of them into the world's own auth entry,
-- where they stayed after the account stopped being an admin or was made
-- again by someone else. For an admin the only news in what comes back
-- is what is missing from it, a revoke: the stored entry loses that and
-- gains nothing.
