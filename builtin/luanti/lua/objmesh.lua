-- Wavefront .obj, as the quads a voxel's shape is made of.
--
-- A Luanti node whose drawtype is "mesh" names a model file, and in this game
-- those are almost all .obj: campfires, flowerpots, signs, lanterns,
-- lecterns, item frames, heads, rails. The format is text and a node mesh
-- uses a corner of it -- "v", "vt", "f" and "usemtl" -- so reading it here is
-- shorter than teaching the engine a mesh format, and what comes out is what
-- the voxel mesher already copies into a chunk: a chunk of lanterns then
-- costs what a chunk of cubes costs.
--
-- A node mesh is authored in the node's own cube of -0.5...0.5, which is the
-- same space VoxelDefinition.shape is in, so the numbers go straight through.
--
-- Nothing here touches a file: parse() takes the text.

local M = {}

-- An index in a face is 1-based from the start of the list, or negative from
-- the end of it, which is what a .obj written by some exporters uses
local function resolve_index(i, count)
	if i == nil then
		return nil
	end
	if i < 0 then
		i = count + 1 + i
	end
	if i < 1 or i > count then
		return nil
	end
	return i
end

-- parse(text) -> quads, groups, skipped
--
-- quads is an array of {group = n, p = {12 numbers}, uv = {8 numbers}}: the
-- corners in the voxel's own -0.5...0.5 cube and the texture coordinates in
-- the tile's own 0...1 with 0,0 at its top left, which is where
-- VoxelDefinition.shape wants them. .obj puts 0,0 at the bottom left, so the
-- second coordinate is turned over.
--
-- group counts up from 1 at every "usemtl", so a mesh with two materials has
-- its faces marked 1 and 2 and the caller can put them on different tiles.
--
-- groups is how many there were and skipped how many faces were not
-- triangles or quads. A triangle comes out as a quad with its last corner
-- twice, which is what the mesher takes and what costs nothing to draw.
