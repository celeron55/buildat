-- Digging, placing and punching, with nobody doing them
--
-- The three things a player's actions come to, and what a mod calls when it
-- wants the same thing to happen without one. Luanti's own l_dig_node,
-- l_place_node and l_punch_node: each makes the pointed thing a player's
-- action would have made, hands it to the vendored builtin with a nil actor,
-- and lets that run the callbacks. So `on_dig`, `can_dig`, `after_dig_node`,
-- `on_construct`, `after_place_node`, the drop list and the registered
-- on_dignodes and on_placenodes are the builtin's own and behave as they do
-- in Luanti, rather than being written again here.
--
-- Where a dig's drops go: core.handle_node_drops() puts them in the digger's
-- inventory when the digger is a player, and hands the rest to
-- core.add_item(), which is the vendored builtin's own item entity now that
-- there are objects for it to be. With no digger there is no inventory to put
-- anything in, so everything a dig drops is spawned.
