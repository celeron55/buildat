# **Does digging make a noise** ([NO_SOUND], the user's bar of 2026-09-24:
# "a mod that never mentions sound still sounds right in Luanti"). Unlike
# the footstep, this one is not the engine's: the vendored builtin's
# node_dig calls core.sound_play with the node's own `dug` group
# (vendor/builtin/game/item.lua:566), and item_place does the same with
# `place` (:289), so what this proves is that the call reaches the
# client's mixer rather than falling down a hole between the two halves.
#
#   builtin/luanti/test/dig_sound.sh
#
# The plan said for a day that digging and placing were "still silent".
# They are not, and this is the check that says so rather than a reading
# of the source.
#
# minetest_game, because its nodes carry sounds; devtest's do not, which
# is why footstep.sh does not ask devtest either. The client runs at -l 4
# because the sound the module plays is a debug line -- a game's own
# sounds are many and an info line a piece would drown the log.
#
# **No device is opened**: SDL_AUDIODRIVER=disk writes the mix to a file,
# which is the user's rule of 2026-09-24 (no default script may put audio
# on the system's hardware). What is read here is the module's own line,
# not the mix; sound.sh is the one that measures the samples.
