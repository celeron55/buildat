# halo is up while the day ramp is still zero, so the ground was black under
# a night sky with a bright halo in it. The same nine hours are shot twice --
# once with the pre-dawn term and once with BUILDAT_LUANTI_NO_PREDAWN=1 --
# and the ground and the sky of each are read against each other: the four
# hours in the two windows must gain, and the three probed hours (02:00,
# 05:45, 20:30) must not move at all.
