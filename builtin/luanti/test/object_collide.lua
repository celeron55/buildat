-- [CLIENT_FRAME]: the two halves of an object's collision with the map,
-- read off the server alone. A dropped item over a dirt platform must come
-- to rest on it, and one dropped over nothing must keep falling. What this
-- is for is the walkable test in entity.lua, which asks the map by content
-- id rather than by building a node table per voxel per axis per object per
-- step; a test that answered "walkable" for everything would rest both, and
-- one that answered "not walkable" would drop both.
