-- a fixture that answers "what is here" has a different here every time, and

-- what they were: the grass under the reference set's fourth viewpoint is
-- `param2 = 14` everywhere, its neighbours are `air/0` and `dirt/0`, and
-- there are forty voxels of open sky over it. Each of those three ruled out
-- a different explanation of what was drawn.
