# [CLIENT_FRAME]: an object's collision with the map, server only. A
# dropped item over a dirt platform comes to rest on it and one dropped
# over nothing keeps falling -- the two answers the walkable test in
# entity.lua has to give, which nothing else in the tree checks. It was
# written when that test stopped building a node table per voxel per axis
# per object per step and started asking by content id. Prints PASS/FAIL.
