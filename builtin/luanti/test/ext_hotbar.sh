# [EXT_HOTBAR]: the extension's hotbar is the row both clients share -- the
# game's own hotbar_image and hotbar_selected_image on it, as many slots as
# the game asked for, in Luanti's own geometry. A VoxeLibre server is what
# reads it: it asks for nine slots, names a marker, and draws its own
# hotbar background as a HUD image element placed against official's row.
# Needs the Luanti checkout the way ext_error.sh does.
