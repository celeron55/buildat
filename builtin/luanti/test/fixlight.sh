# [UNDERGROUND_LIGHT]: **/fixlight's radius forms, and the daylight they put
# back.** Two things nothing else in the tree held:
#
#   * a world has daylight in it -- open air over the surface reads 15 at
#     noon. A played world that had lost its light drew every canopy shadow
#     and every cave mouth black and gray, and no runner would have said so
#     (the playtest fault, 2026-09-28);
#   * /fixlight takes a bare radius (user, 2026-09-28): none is 32, a number
#     on its own is that radius, and Luanti's own forms still answer -- so a
#     patch of world that went dark can be asked for by the ground the
#     player is standing on.
#
# The world is made fresh and the command is called as a player would type
# it. Prints PASS or FAIL; the log is under local/fixlight_check/.
#
# simplified: that /fixlight *repairs* a dark world is not staged here. A
# VoxelManip set_lighting()/write_to_map(false) does not leave the light
# zeroed -- read back at once it is already 15 again -- so there is no way
# in Lua to make the damage this is about. It was measured by hand on the
# world that reported it (the plan, [UNDERGROUND_LIGHT]); staging it wants
# a way to stop the flood, which is the upgrade path.
