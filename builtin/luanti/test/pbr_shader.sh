# **Nothing in this tree could fail on a change to the shader the Luanti
# clients draw with** (user, 2026-09-25; [UNDERGROUND_LIGHT] (3)).
# apps/voxel_lighting/check.sh guards its own game's look and reads
# builtin/voxel_shading's shader; `extensions/luanti_client/res/
# PBRVoxel.glsl` -- the one apps/vanilla actually draws with -- had no
# runner at all, and the light terms, the gray ramp and the zone the
# ambient comes from were all changed in a week with nothing able to go
# red.
#
# **Three views at 13:00 and one at 20:30 against the stored set**, by RMSE, the same
# shape apps/voxel_lighting/check.sh uses: vp1 (the open surface the
# ambient is fitted to), vp8 (a lamp in a cave) and vp10 (a chamber with
# no sky of its own), and **vp1 again at 20:30**.
#
# **The night view is what makes this able to fail.** Broken on purpose
# 2026-09-28 -- the sky ambient multiplied by 1.5 in PBRVoxel.glsl --
# the three noon views read 5.22, 3.66 and 2.51 against a noise floor of
# about 3: **the check passed a fifty percent change to the term it
# exists to guard**, because at 13:00 the sun is most of the picture and
# the ambient is a sliver of it. At 20:30 the ambient is the picture.
# One mode, four states: two minutes rather than [PROBE_CYCLE]'s ten.
#
# The reference is local/reference_shots/module_pbr_r150, which
# reference_shots/shoot_buildat_server.sh writes; this shoots into a
# scratch directory of its own and never touches it.

# **The bar is measured, not picked** ([CHECK_BASELINE]): two shoots of
# one unchanged tree differ by the sky-visibility sweep, whose rays are
# not the same rays twice. Read on this desk 2026-09-28, an unchanged
# tree against a set shot minutes before it: **2.92, 3.98 and 2.45** for
# vp1, vp8 and vp10. Twenty is well above that and well below a real
# change -- apps/voxel_lighting measures those at 72 to 868.
# **Two readings per view, because one of them is blunt.** The RMSE
# catches a change of shape -- a term that moved somewhere and not
# elsewhere -- and its floor is the sky-visibility sweep, whose rays are
# not the same rays twice: measured on this desk 2026-09-28, an
# unchanged tree against a set shot minutes before it, 2.89 / 3.94 /
# 2.46 at noon and 3.89 at night. Twenty is well above that.
#
# **But RMSE could not see a fifty percent change to the sky ambient**
# (broken on purpose, 2026-09-28: 5.22 at vp1 13:00 against a floor of
# 3), so the frame's **mean level** carries the assertion and the RMSE
# is the backstop.
#
# **Only two of the four get a mean assertion**, and which two was
# measured rather than picked -- the first two guesses were both wrong
# and both cost a run. Across the shoots of one unchanged tree taken
# that day:
#
#     vp1  13:00   120.72 / 120.69 / 121.44 / 120.69   spread 0.75
#     vp8  13:00   125.22 / 125.17 / 125.26 / 124.98   spread 0.28
#     vp10 13:00    80.02 / 80.02 / 80.02 / 80.02      spread 0.00
#     vp1  20:30    16.09 / 16.13 / 16.08              spread 0.05
#
# The open surfaces wander with the sky-visibility sweep and the break
# moved vp1 13:00 by only 1.04, so no tolerance separates them there.
# vp10 and vp1 20:30 are steady, and the same break moved vp1 20:30 by
# 0.78 -- fifteen times its own spread. So those two carry the level
# and the open noon views are read by RMSE alone.
