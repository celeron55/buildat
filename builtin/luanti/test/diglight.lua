-- twenty-step stair from it by t=100, the player put at its bottom at
-- t=105, and each second the server's reading at the pit's air and at
-- the stair's bottom, as core.get_node_light(pos, 0.5) (the sun's share
-- alone, so the hour is out of it). The client's half is diglight.sh:
-- `scan` and `scan_volume ... light` at t=15, t=70 and t=115.
-- The pit should read a level under the air over it (logged before the
-- dig) and the stair's bottom 0 on both; whichever copy differs names
-- the fault.
