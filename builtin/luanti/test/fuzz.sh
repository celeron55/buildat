# [AUTO_PLAYTEST] part 1: a fuzz run. A fresh world, a client that walks at
# random for MINUTES from a seeded RNG, and fuzz.lua asserting invariants on
# the server once a second. The runner reads both logs afterwards.
#
#   SEED=7 MINUTES=5 GAME=mineclone2 builtin/luanti/test/fuzz.sh
#
# The same SEED replays the same walk: it seeds both the world and the
# command file. What is written per run lands under local/fuzz/<seed>/:
# the command file, both logs, and a screenshot every thirty seconds for a
# person to look through when the run fails.
#
# LOG_LEVEL=6 has every slow step at trace with the emerge phase broken
# down ([STEP_PEAK]); the default 4 is verbose. CLIENT_LOG_LEVEL=5 has the
# client's frames over 50 ms with their phases and Urho's profiler table
# beside every frame peak line over the ceiling ([FRAME_PEAK]).
# Never beside another buildat_server: the save's sqlite and the desktop
# are one each.
