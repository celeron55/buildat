# [SCAN_DRIVE]: the player commanded from what the scan shows. A loop of
# scan, read, act: `event scan` is written to the client's stdin (a fifo
# drive.sh holds), the block it logs is read off cli.log, the first rule
# whose condition holds writes its commands, and the rule's expectation
# is asserted on the next scan. The rules are the playtest's intent and
# are listed in doc/plan/luanti_module_plan.md under [SCAN_DRIVE]; the
# invariants are the fixture's (fuzz.lua), which runs on the server the
# same as under fuzz.sh.
#
#   drive.py <cli.log> <fifo> <minutes> <out dir> [seed] [goal rung]
#
# A run has a goal ([DRIVE_GOAL]): the rung whose product ends it, the
# minutes a ceiling. Met, it writes "drive: GOAL <rung> met at turn N,
# t=S" and quits; the minutes running out first is "GOAL <rung> not met".
#
# Python 3, nothing else. Every turn's rule and every failed expectation
# is a `drive:` line on stdout, which drive.sh keeps beside the logs.
