# **Every Lua file in the tree parses** -- the cheapest coverage there
# is, and the only thing at all that reads most of them: thirteen games'
# `client_lua` is started by no check ([SMOKE_PICK]'s coverage map,
# 2026-09-25), so a file broken by a bulk edit -- a sed over fifteen
# games, say -- sat there until somebody started that game by hand.

#
# **What it is not**: a check that the code works. It parses, nothing
# more. It parses with LuaJIT where the desk has it, which is the
# dialect the game runs; with only luac (5.4), a file using 5.3's `//`
# passes this and fails there.
#
# tier: quick
# cost: 3s
# always: yes
#
# **No covers line, and always run.** A shallow check that names half
# the tree would win every "cheapest runner that covers this file" race
# and push the deep ones out ([SMOKE_PICK]'s greedy pick): asked for a
# change under games/, it answered "the syntax check, 3 s" instead of
# the runner that starts the game. So it competes for nothing and runs
# anyway, which is what a check costing under a second is for.
