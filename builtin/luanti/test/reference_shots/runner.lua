-- The reference shot set's viewpoints, hours and weather, for comparing this
-- module against official Luanti and against extensions/luanti_client.
--
-- **The same file serves all three clients**, because both buildat clients
-- run the game's code through this module and official Luanti runs it as a
-- worldmod. See [OFFICIAL_SHOTS] in doc/plan/rendering_plan.md, which
-- settles the set: mineclone2 only, one world, eight viewpoints,
-- twenty-three pictures a client.
--
-- As this module's fixture:
--
--   BUILDAT_LUANTI_GAME=mineclone2 BUILDAT_LUANTI_SAVE=refviews \
--   BUILDAT_LUANTI_IMPORT=~/projects/luanti/worlds/mc2_2026-09-15_0033 \
--   BUILDAT_LUANTI_LUA=<build.sh's fixture.lua> \
--   bin/buildat_server -m ../games/vanilla -D ../user
--
-- As official Luanti's, build.sh's refviews/ dropped into <world>/worldmods.
--
-- **Which viewpoints run is decided by the world's seed**: the reference
-- world gets all eight, any other is refused when build.sh named the seed
-- and shot at one hour when it did not (a fixture concatenated by hand).
--
-- **Each state is announced in the log** as `REFSHOT <n> <name>`, and the
-- name is the file stem the shot is saved under. A script that drives the
-- shots waits for that line rather than counting seconds, so the two cannot
-- drift apart.
--
-- **The aim is re-asserted every second.** The official client's input is
-- not disabled and the machine is in use, so a stray mouse movement turns
-- the camera; the aim is server-side and authoritative, so it comes back.
-- See [OFFICIAL_SHOTS], "It runs on the user's own desktop".

-- The numbers -- viewpoints, hours, range, hold -- are set.lua's, which
-- build.sh concatenates in front of this file; this file is behaviour and
-- holds none of them. See [REFVIEWS_MOD].

local HOLD = tonumber(rawget(_G, "REFSHOT_HOLD")) or REFSET.hold
-- How often the aim is put back, which has to fit inside the hold: at a
-- second it is four re-aims of a six second state, and at a quarter of that
-- it is still four. The calibration ladder halves one thing at a time, and
-- this one follows the hold rather than being a second variable.
local REAIM = HOLD / 6

-- **The world is frozen while a set is taken** -- see [FROZEN_WORLD] in
-- doc/plan/rendering_plan.md. A set is meant to be of the world the file
-- holds, and a running game does not leave it that way: VoxeLibre's
-- `fix_grass_palette_indexes` repaints grass from the biome *this* version
-- of the game computes, which on a world five minor versions older is a
-- different green, and that was read as a rendering fault for two days. Snow
-- melts, grass spreads, mobs walk out of frame. And it is most of a run's
-- cost: 229 seconds of LBMs and 83 of ABMs out of 960.
--
-- **The hook is early enough in both engines, which is the point.** Luanti
-- reads `core.registered_abms` and `core.registered_lbms` into C++ in
-- `initializeEnvironment()` (`server.cpp:585`), after `loadMods()` (`:534`)
-- has fired this callback; the module reads the same two tables live in
-- `run_abms()` and `run_lbms()`. So one function freezes both, and a fixture
-- that froze only one of them would make the halves less comparable rather
-- than more.
--
-- Not the globalsteps: the weather states need mcl_weather alive, and the
-- fixture drives it deliberately.
--
-- Mobs are not spawned. Natural spawn is not repeatable across engines, so
-- a skeleton in one half and not the other reads as a lighting fault. Later
-- the fixture should place mobs and entities as static props to test their
-- lighting; until then they stay out. See [FROZEN_WORLD].
