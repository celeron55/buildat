# Stands up `luanti --server` on the reference world and puts one client in
# front of it: official Luanti (the default) or extensions/luanti_client,
# both being Luanti clients of the same server and the same worldmod. The
# module's client has no Luanti server and shoot_buildat_server.sh beside
# this is its runner. The set lands in $REFSHOT_SHOTS_DIR/<client>_<mode>_r<RANGE>.
#
# A fixture is a seed and its mapgen settings, never a world directory -- see
# "A fixture is a seed, never a copy" -- and the settings are the whole of
# map_meta.txt beside this file rather than a few keys out of it. The world
# is generated into a cache under $REFSHOT_WORLDS_DIR and reused if it is
# already there, so a bulk session pays for the terrain once. The worldmod in
# it is build.sh's, the same fixture the module runs, so the two sides line
# up by construction rather than by aim.
#
# It waits for the fixture's own "REFSHOT <n> <name>" line in the server log
# and shoots within a second of it, rather than counting seconds: the aim is
# re-asserted every second, so a shot taken right after one is the one least
# likely to have been spoiled by the desktop's real mouse.
