-- [WATER_LIGHT]: a passage dug into the ground with a water run in it, lit
-- from a shaft, read a node at a time. The one probe the item asks for:
-- how far the sky's light travels along water and down through it.
--
-- Dug into real terrain rather than built in the air: a chamber carved out
-- of stone starts dark, which is what makes a light reading mean anything.
