# [MENU_MUSIC]: **does a game's music stop when the player leaves to the
# launch menu**. The launcher's own path (-a, the client starting the
# server), devtest with menu_music.lua looping one sound at the player and
# never stopping it, then the pause menu's "Leave the game" and six seconds
# in the launch menu. The mix goes to a file (SDL_AUDIODRIVER=disk, as
# sound.sh, which has the why of it); its size is taken when the client
# logs leave_to_menu(), and the peak of the second before is held against
# the peak from two seconds after it to the end.
