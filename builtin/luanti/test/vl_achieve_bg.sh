# [VL_ACHIEVE_BG]: VoxeLibre's achievements form keeps its backdrop on
# every item of its list. An item with progress adds a progress bar as a
# background[] of its own, and the form's backdrop was drawn only for a
# form with no background[] at all, so a click on such an item took it
# away. The fixture does what a click on the list does -- shows the form
# again with that item -- an item without a bar, then one with, and holds
# it; the client shoots every second, and each shot with the bar in it
# must have the backdrop's grey around it -- VoxeLibre's own light panel
# since the server sends the formspec prepend ([VL_INV_PARITY]), where it
# was the client's dark one. Vanilla, 1280x720.
