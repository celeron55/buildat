# [NO_SOUND] / [ROOM_SOUND]: **does a sound the server asks for reach
# the mixer**. Nothing in this tree could hear, so a room that placed no
# listener played into nowhere until somebody noticed.
#
#   builtin/luanti/test/sound.sh
#
# sound.lua asks for three sounds every four seconds through
# core.sound_play(), which is the one thing that is unambiguously a
# packet.
#
# **Digging and placing do play** (measured 2026-09-25, against this
# file's own earlier note that they were not implemented at all): the
# vendored builtin's node_dig and item_place call core.sound_play with
# the node's `dug` and `place`, and predict.sh's run has the
# luanti:sound packet to show for it. **Footsteps are the ones official
# Luanti plays in its engine** off the player's movement, which nothing
# here did until 2026-09-25; builtin/luanti/test/footstep.sh is that
# one's check.
#
# **No device is opened at all** (the user's rule, 2026-09-24: no
# default script may put audio on the system's actual hardware; only
# when asked, and only for that run). SDL_AUDIODRIVER=disk with
# SDL_DISKAUDIOFILE writes the mix to a file instead -- SDL's disk
# driver is compiled in here -- so there is nothing to leak to the
# speakers, nothing to race another check for the sink, and nothing
# that needs PipeWire running, which is what also makes this work in
# the packaging container.
#
# **SDL_DISKAUDIODELAY stays unset**: at 0 the mixer runs flat out and
# writes 1.4 GB in nine seconds; unset, it writes in real time.
#
# **-o sound_mute=0**: a -c run is muted on purpose (app.cpp:1028, "a
# driven run playing a game's music through the developer's speakers"),
# and with the disk driver there are no speakers to play through.
