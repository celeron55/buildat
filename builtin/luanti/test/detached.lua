-- A detached inventory, which belongs to nobody: a form shows one, what is

-- Connect a client and press I: the form has the player's own slots under a
-- row of three, which is the detached inventory, holding stone, dirt and
-- sand. Moving a stack in or out logs what the callbacks were told -- and
-- the left button carries the whole stack, the right button one item of it
-- and the middle button ten, which is Luanti's own rule and is what the
-- logged counts say.
--
-- It is also where the slot tooltip is seen: rest the mouse on one of the
-- three and the item's description appears beside the cursor, with the name
-- it is known by under it.
