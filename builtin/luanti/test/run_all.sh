# Runs every runner of a tier, one at a time, and says what each did
# ([CI_RUNS] (2)). The tier is named in the runner itself, on a
# "# tier:" line near the top:
#
#   quick  needs no downloaded game -- what a push runs
#   full   wants the game media (mineclone2, VoxeLibre)
#   long   the fuzz, the drives, the reference shots
#
#   builtin/luanti/test/run_all.sh quick
#   builtin/luanti/test/run_all.sh full --list
#   ONLY='keys.*|focus' builtin/luanti/test/run_all.sh quick
#
# **--changed [range] is the regular check** ([SMOKE_PICK]): it takes
# what git says changed and runs the cheapest runners that cover it,
# which is one runner under a minute for most commits. The whole tier
# is what a push runs.
#
#   builtin/luanti/test/run_all.sh --changed
#   builtin/luanti/test/run_all.sh --changed origin/dev..HEAD --list
#
# **What a runner covers is where it lives**, so most of them say
# nothing: a check under extensions/<x>/ covers extensions/<x>/**, one
# under games/<g>/ covers games/<g>/**, and one in this directory
# covers builtin/luanti/**. A "# covers:" line *adds* paths a runner
# also proves -- the client's own sources, mostly -- and only the
# runners that prove something outside their own tree carry one. A
# central table of paths to runners would be a second place to forget.
# **What a runner costs** is measured: every run appends its seconds to
# local/run_all/costs, and a "# cost:" line seeds one that has never
# run here. An unknown runner is assumed to cost a minute.
#
# The exit status is the run's: 0 if every runner passed or skipped, 1 if
# any failed. A runner is never retried -- a check run three times and
# taken at its best is how a real fault becomes a known flake
# ([CI_RUNS] (6)); a known flake is marked "# flaky:" in the runner and
# is run and reported but does not decide the status.
