# [CLIENT_FRAME]: **a client with no cache at all.** Every announced file
# has to be asked for, and the scripts that follow the announce -- a
# module's client half, which requires the modules whose files are still
# on the way -- must not be run until they have arrived. The client checks
# the cache on a worker now, and the first shape of that let the scripts
# past: `modules.lua:23: attempt to concatenate local 'err'`, and the
# world never drew. devtest, so it is six hundred files rather than five
# thousand. Prints PASS or FAIL.
