# [WATER_LIGHT]: how far the sky's light travels along water in a roofed
# passage. The fixture builds a tunnel with one opening to the sky and a
# water run under it, and reads every node of the run; official diminishes
# through water a level a node, so the far end must be darker than the near
# one and the flowing node must read as the source beside it.
