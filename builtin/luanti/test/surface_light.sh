# [UNDERGROUND_LIGHT] (3)'s own assertion: **open air over a surface
# reads 15 at noon**, which nothing asserted, and again after the light
# in the box has been worked out.
#
# **What this does and does not catch.** The first reading is the
# assertion and it is real. The second -- after `core.fix_light` over a
# box whose top is under the loaded column, which is the shape
# [SKY_COLUMN_CAVE]'s fault had -- **has not been seen to fail**: run
# with the broken rule put back (`BUILDAT_SKY_COLUMN=0`, removed since),
# this world still read 15 across the board. devtest's world is small and
# flat and its region top is near the player, so the relight finds a sky
# source either way. Reproducing the fault wants a played VoxeLibre
# world, which is [SKY_COLUMN_CAVE]'s own drive and not a quick check.
# So the fix_light half is kept for the day it does catch something and
# is not counted as cover.
