-- A game's own sky: six pictures on a cube rather than the gradient a
-- "regular" sky asks for, which is what `set_sky({type = "skybox",
-- textures = {...}})` means and what nodecore's night of coloured stars and
-- nebulae is.
--
-- A node of its own, disabled until a game asks for one: the gradient sky
-- belongs to `builtin/voxel_shading` and every game that says nothing keeps
-- it exactly as it was. In its own file because init.lua is at Lua 5.1's
-- limit of two hundred locals in a chunk.
--
-- simplified: the cube is built from the pictures as they arrive and rebuilt
-- only when the six names change. nodecore darkens its own faces by level,
-- which arrives as six new names and is handled; a texture whose own content
-- changes underneath is not.
