-- what a program whose whole look is procedural needs ([LAUNCH_WORLD]).
-- Asserted rather than looked at, so a whitelist entry that goes missing
-- fails a run instead of drawing nothing (see [WHITELIST_POLICY]).
-- Held at file scope: a Texture2D made in Lua is owned by Lua, and a local
-- that goes out of scope takes the texture with it even though an element
-- is drawing with it (the same lifetime trap as a cached Material)
