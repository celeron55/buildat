	// and no data to keep in step with the material ids.
	//
	// A structure carries its own air. A cathedral inside a hill is no use,
	// so the footprint is cleared as it is written -- which is why this is
	// set_voxel() per voxel and not Instance::merge_volume(), whose whole
	// contract is that it does not overwrite what is already there.
	//
