# from digger (rock, dirt, grass, water). The output is committed, so this

# 16x16 to match the textures already there, and RGB rather than RGBA
# because none of these has a hole in it. No normal or roughness map: the
# atlas derives both from the texture itself, see src/impl/atlas.cpp.
#
# What each texture has to do is say what the material *does* -- bedrock is
# not diggable, timber holds a span, brick carries weight -- from across a
# dark tunnel, so each is one clear pattern rather than a detailed surface.
