# Generates the two environment cube maps the voxel shader reflects and the
# water texture. The output is committed, so this only needs running when one of them
# is being changed.
#
# Everything is written into a client_data directory, from where the server
# hands it to the client on connect. The cube maps go to the voxel_shading
# module, next to the shader that reflects them; the water texture is this
# game's alone.
#
# The other voxel textures are hand drawn and predate this; there is no normal
# or roughness map for any of them, because the atlas derives both from the
# texture itself (see src/impl/atlas.cpp).
#
# A sun disc is drawn, a few degrees across rather than the half degree the
# real one is: at this resolution a half-degree disc is smaller than a texel.
# It is what gives a glossy surface something with contrast in it to reflect,
# which is what a highlight needs. The scene's directional light also draws the
# sun's highlight, so a surface facing it right gets both; the disc is kept at
# the top of the 8 bit range rather than made an HDR value so that the two stay
# close in brightness instead of the reflection swamping the light.
#
# Values are in the same scale as the zone's ambient color, which is what a
# surface with full skylight receives: this map is the same sky seen in a
# mirror rather than a separate, brighter one.

# The indoor map, which the shader fades to as the camera loses sight of the

# under a surface indoors is whatever the room is made of, and neither a blue
# ceiling nor a lit floor can be assumed here. The grey is the dimmed horizon's
# own brightness, so they meet without a seam. No sun disc and no glow.
# A brighter ring at the horizon stands in for the windows, and is most of what
# makes an indoor reflection interesting rather than flat grey. Its half width
# is in units of sin(elevation), so 0.45 is about 27 degrees either side.
