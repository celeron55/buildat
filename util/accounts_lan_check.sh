# [ACCOUNTS_LAN]: "Open to LAN" is builtin/accounts' Server window's.
#   1. Floor planner launched from the launcher: its owner opens the Server
#      window, Mine > Open to LAN, and its button; the server listens at
#      the LAN address too and is announced as "floorplanner".
#   2. A raw peer at the LAN address, and one on a server the launcher
#      did not start, ask with accounts:open_lan and are refused.
#   3. A second client finds it under "This network", joins and
#      registers; its Server window has no Open to LAN.
#   4. Vanilla on the bundled minimal game: the pause menu's Open to LAN
#      opens it, announced under the world's name.
# Screenshots in $t (KEEP_TMP=1 keeps it): a_before, a_after, b_window,
# v_after.
