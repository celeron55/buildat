# [PACKAGE_SUBJECT], the first slice: **a release is a thread in its home
# Hearth**. An Aitta and a Hearth side by side; tester publishes demo 1.0
# naming the Hearth its home, with a changelog, and other/elsewhere 1.0
# naming another. Hearth's admin sets the release sources (the Aitta, and
# the Hearth's own address): demo 1.0 becomes one thread in "Releases",
# by "tester (Aitta)", with the changelog; elsewhere does not; a restart
# makes no second thread. "Feedback..." on the installed demo's tile
# opens the composer there with the package and versions; its thread is a
# problem reported in 1.0, which the admin marks fixed in 1.1; demo 1.1's
# release thread links it and its reporter is told.
