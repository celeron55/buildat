# [LAN_DISCOVERY]: a server announces itself on the LAN's group only when
# told to, and a client's list holds a flood of false ones to 32.
#   1. digger with --lan-announce: an announcement with its name and port
#      is heard on 239.255.29.50:29599 within 5 s.
#   2. digger without it: nothing from its port in 5 s.
#   3. 100 false announcements (other ports, control characters in the
#      name) while a client shows the connect screen: the client says its
#      list is full, and the screenshot shows 32 at most.
#   4. [WIN_FIREWALL]: a fresh client holds no socket on the LAN port
#      (Windows' firewall asks about one) until the player opens the
#      connect screen's "This network". From the start once that is in
#      the preferences: 3, by -o.
