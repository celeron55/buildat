# [VERSION_CHECK]: a Starport whose version adapter says 0.9.0 carries it
# in /api/list, filtered (a bad platform left out); the launcher shows the
# notice, "Not now" is kept across a restart, a newer version (0.9.1) is
# told again, and "Download" hands the platform's link to the system's
# opener (an xdg-open of this check's own on PATH).
# [VERSION_DOWNLOAD]: after it the amber text names the file (a .tar.gz's
# says extract, an .exe's run) and "Close Buildat" ends the client.
# The GitHub adapter prints the newest release, when GitHub answers.
