# [SELECT_BAD_FD], the second half: the first page load after a start
# deflated the wasm and the data in the network module, about a second
# each, and every peer waited on it -- a page's other requests, the game's
# clients. Now the copies are made on threads of their own, and a file
# goes as it is until its copy is ready.
# A fresh server; the data asked for with deflate, and beside it the page,
# which must come at once. The data is a generated 60 MB, so that its
# deflate takes seconds on any machine, as the real one does on a small
# server's CPU: on this desk the real files deflate in 0.2 s, which a
# stalled page load does not stand out from.
# Needs web/ from util/build_web.sh.
