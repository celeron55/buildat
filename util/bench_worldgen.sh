# How long a world takes to make itself.

#   util/bench_worldgen.sh [game] [runs] [seed] [sections across] [save]
#
# The server alone -- no client, nothing connected -- making a new world out
# of a fixed seed, which is the one phase of a Luanti game that is entirely
# this engine's own work: the mapgen, the light, the serialization and the
# streamer. Every run starts from an empty save and the same seed and asks
# for the same box of sections, so every run does the same work, which is
# what makes two of them comparable.
#
# The box is what makes it a workload rather than a moment: the world around
# the origin is a few dozen sections and over in three seconds, which is
# mostly startup. Six across is 6 x 2 x 6 sections and about half a minute of
# devtest.
#
# What it prints per run is how many sections were generated and how long the
# generation took, and then the median. Read the median: a single run of
# anything here moves by tens of percent with whatever else the machine is
# doing, which is how a "throughput" number that meant nothing got into
# doc/most_important_performance_issues.txt once.
#
# The seed is Luanti's own fixed_map_seed, written into the save's world.mt
# before the server opens it. Anything else that needs to be the same between
# runs goes in the same place.
