# [SECURITY_RUN_2] the box's compile reads: a module's C++ source is
# compiled by the server inside the Landlock box (confine.cpp). The box
# lets the compiler read the system (/usr /lib /bin /etc /opt /nix /proc
# /sys) and the app's own paths, and nothing else -- not /home, /root,
# /run, /var, /tmp. So a hostile app cannot make its compile read the
# user's files. This drives that: an app whose module #includes a file
# that exists outside the box must be refused by Landlock (EACCES,
# "Permission denied"), while a system path (/etc/hostname) is let
# through. A broken box would open the outside file and splice its bytes.
