#
# **An app from an Aitta** ([AITTA_SERVE]): a game <author>/<name> (a slash
# tells it from the release's own apps) runs the newest version installed
# under <user dir>/installed/<author>/<name>/, which
#   bin/buildat aitta install <Aitta> <author>/<name> <user dir>
# (in a release's directory) puts there; the server calls it
# <author>.<name>, as its saves under <user dir>/apps/. Its version moves
# only when told: with AITTA=<the Aitta's address>, each update check
# installs the app's newest listed release there and restarts onto it as
# for a new engine release, with the same wait and warning; without it the
# installed version stays. Not installed and no AITTA: the script says how
# and stops. **A delisted release** ([SERVE_DELISTED]): each check also
# reads the Aitta's list of what it delisted, and why. The running
# release delisted as malware or CSAM is stopped, a stand-in on its port
# saying it was withdrawn by its Aitta, until a newer listed release is
# installed and compiled. Delisted for another reason: said once in the
# log, and it runs on. simplified: no rollback to an older listed version;
# for one, stop this script, remove the withdrawn version's directory under
# installed/, and start it again -- the newest one left runs.
#
# Each server is a game, a port and a user directory, which holds its
# saves and accounts. Every version uses it (-D), and it can be one a
# server used before. Each server has its own: two given one directory
# would share saves and accounts, and the script refuses to start. The
# servers all run the same release. The rest is under BUILDAT_SERVE_DIR
# (default ~/buildat-serve):
#   versions/<archive>/     each release, unpacked
#   current                 the version running
#   server-<game>-<port>.log  a server's output, also on the terminal with
#                           [<game>:<port>] before each line
# **A new release** ([SERVE_UPDATE_SMOOTH]) is downloaded and unpacked,
# and each server's app compiled on it (--compile-only) while the old one
# serves. A compile that fails keeps every server on the old version, and
# that release is not tried again; a newer one is. **The restart waits
# for nobody to be on** ([SERVE_UPDATE_POLITE]): every server's /health
# says 0 players, or UPDATE_MAX_WAIT seconds (1800) have passed since the
# release compiled. A minute before that, whoever is on is told
# ("<user dir>/apps/<game>/notice", which the server shows every client),
# and a server listed on a Starport is listed as updating. Then one
# server at a time: <user dir>/apps/<game>/shutdown_reason written ("updating to X"),
# which the server tells its clients as it goes (they wait and rejoin),
# stopped with SIGTERM (a game saves on it), started on the new version,
# a stand-in on its port meanwhile, and the next once it is listening.
# A server that exits is started again by itself. Every version but
# the running one and the one before it is deleted. A server that exits with
# status 20 is a game's own restart (apps/vanilla switching its world), and
# is started again at once; meanwhile a stand-in on its port answers a
# browser with a page that says so and reloads itself, until the server
# says it is listening (they share the port: BUILDAT_SHARE_PORT=1).
#
# **The box** ([PROCESS_SANDBOX], 0.5.67 and newer): each server confines
# itself, and refuses to start on a kernel without Landlock unless given
# --unconfined. A boxed server connects out only to ports 80, 443, 465,
# 587, 29500 and 29595; a Starport that lists servers on other ports is
# given more by a file in its user directory, <user dir>/connect_ports,
# one line: "any", or a list such as "8080,30000" -- or as a server option,
# "--connect-ports any".
#
# **A rollback** is by hand, with this script stopped: run the version
# before from its directory,
#   cd ~/buildat-serve/versions/<the one before>
#   bin/buildat_server -m apps/<app> -P <port> -D <user dir>
# for each server. To a release from before apps were called apps
# (0.5.57 and older), it is -m games/<app>, and <user dir>/apps is moved
# back to <user dir>/games first: a newer server moved it on its start.
# Started again, this script goes back to the newest release. A game whose
# saves carry a schema version (the floorplanner) refuses a save that a
# newer version wrote.
#
# **Compiled modules from a build host** ([SERVE_BUILDS]): with
# BUILDS_URL, before each compile -- a new release's, a new Aitta
# version's -- the host is asked (GET, release=<the release's directory
# name>, app=<game>, and for an Aitta app aitta=<AITTA> and
# version=<its version>) for the app's compiled modules: 200 is a tar of
# them (regular files at its top, *.so and *.so.hash), unpacked into the
# release's cache under apps/<app>/rccpp_build, and the compile that
# follows finds them current; 202 is "building", asked again in
# BUILDS_POLL seconds (30) or its Retry-After; 422 is a failed build, its
# body the log, taken as a failed compile; 404 is none offered, and it is
# compiled here, as it is after BUILDS_MAX_WAIT seconds (7200) without an
# answer. The waiting keeps the servers watched; with nothing running yet,
# each port's stand-in says what is building. The tar is code the servers
# load: BUILDS_URL is https, or http to a loopback or private address.
# A server given --unconfined builds into the shared cache and asks
# nothing. simplified: a server option -C (its cache elsewhere) is not
# followed; BUILDAT_CACHE_PATH is.
#
# Environment: AITTA (above), POLL_SECONDS (300), UPDATE_MAX_WAIT (1800),
# GITHUB_REPO (celeron55/buildat),
# GITHUB_TOKEN (optional; unauthenticated, GitHub allows 60 asks an hour),
# RELEASES_URL (GitHub's list of the repo's releases; a check serves its
# own), BUILDS_URL, BUILDS_POLL and BUILDS_MAX_WAIT (above).
# Needs bash, curl and tar; python3 for the stand-in, which is skipped
