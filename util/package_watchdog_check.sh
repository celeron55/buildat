# out of the waited process's tree and its comm is cut to
# "buildat_server.", so its own work before the first compile read as no
# CPU and a slow runner failed 0.6.32's package as a hang.
#
# Two cases, no Wine needed: a process outside the tree whose command
# line is a Windows one keeps the CPU moving while the log is silent for
# 35 s -- the line it waits for comes, and the wait passes; and a real
# hang -- nothing moving -- is still failed at 30 s.
