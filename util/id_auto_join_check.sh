# [ID_AUTO_JOIN]: a local Starport and a Hearth listed on it, an admin
# made there first; a client with a Starport ID signed in.
#   1. The first join shows the dialog; Return signs in with the ID (the
#      community's name asked once), and the client marks the server.
#   2. The second join signs in with the ID by itself: no key pressed.
#   3. Log out drops the mark; the third join shows the dialog again (no
#      "Signing in with the Starport ID").
#   4. Signed in by the ID again, then a password login there drops the
#      mark too; the next join shows the dialog.
# Screenshots in $t (KEEP_TMP=1 keeps it).
