# covers: apps/vanilla/main/client_lua/pause.lua close() clearing the UI focus
# [PAUSE_VOLUME_KEYS]: a pause-menu button clicked here stayed the UI's focus
# element after its window was gone, and then Space (jump) and Enter worked it
# from the world -- a jump cycled the view range and the volume. close() now
# calls magic.ui:SetFocusElement(nil).
#
# Driven in a minimal world: open the pause menu, pick a view range from its
# dropdown, which leaves it focused (logs "view range: N"), close the menu
# with Escape, then jump five times with Space. With the focus cleared the
# jumps reach the world and the range is unchanged; with the bug the detached
# control fires, logging more "view range:" lines.
#
# Scripted keypresses are dropped now and then (a known flake of the driver),
# so a run only counts when it is conclusive: the click registered AND the menu
# is confirmed closed afterwards. F5 (the detail line) is the probe -- while the
# menu holds input a world key is swallowed, so a status line printed after the
# jumps means the menu really closed. Inconclusive runs are retried.
