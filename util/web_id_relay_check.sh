# [WEB_ID_RELAY]: the web client has no HTTPS of its own; its server relays a
# raw TCP connection to a Starport and the client runs TLS over it in Lua.
# The relay is one connection per peer, reused back to back. A finished
# connection's last "closed by the Starport" could arrive after the next call
# had taken over the single relay packet handler, so that call failed with a
# relay error before its own response -- the web client then showed "The
# Starport cannot be reached" (or, with a saved login, the password prompt,
# the real reason only in the log). Each call now tags its connection with a
# generation id (client sends it on relay_open, the server echoes it on
# data/closed), so a call ignores what is not its own.
#
# The drive, with no full browser: a native client with BUILDAT_HTTP_RELAY=1
# (the same relay path the page takes) makes several back-to-back calls to the
# real Starport through a local server that lists it. Every call must get its
# own answer; none may fail with "relay:". Reverting the client's gen filter
# makes a middle call fail here.
