# [AITTA_PUBLISH_UI]: publishing without a terminal, at 800x600, on a
# fresh user path and a local Aitta. Settings -> Developer's "Publish an
# app or extension" (found by typing "publish"):
#   1. "New app..." refuses a bad name with its reason, then makes hello
#      in <user>/dev_apps; the form refuses a bad author with its reason;
#   2. the key is made, bound on the Aitta by the handover (the Aitta's
#      Bind form filled in), and the screen then says it is bound;
#   3. packed and published; the same version again refused in words
#      with "Raise the version", which publishes as 0.1.1;
#   4. an extension the same way;
#   5. hello played from its Dev tile; both releases installed from "Apps
#      from Aitta" on a second client.
# Keys drive the publish screen (Tab, Return: its layout moves with the
# paths in it); the mouse the Aitta's page and Apps from Aitta, whose
# layouts are fixed.
