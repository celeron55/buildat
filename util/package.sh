# Configures a build tree per archive under Build/package/, builds, runs the
# install rules into a staging directory, gathers every third-party licence
# into licenses/, writes VERSION, makes the archive under Build/package/out/,
# and smoke-tests it: unpacks into a clean directory, starts buildat_server
# on apps/digger -- which compiles a module at run time through the found
# or bundled compiler -- connects a client that takes one screenshot that is
# not black, and quits. Nothing is packaged by hand. Runs the same inside
# util/docker's images as on a desk.

# The two Linux archives differ by one flag: PORTABLE keeps user/ and cache/
