# [SERVE_UPDATE_SMOOTH]: util/serve_latest_release.sh with floorplanner and
# vanilla, fed "releases" made from this tree (its binaries, each with an
# apps/ of its own) from a local list in place of GitHub's. A user
# directory given twice is refused. A new release is compiled for both
# before either stops; one server restarts at a time, its start compiling
# nothing; a native client (joined through the launcher) and a web client
# in floorplanner are told why and are back in their plan without a
# click. A release whose module does not compile leaves both on the old
# one, and is not tried again.
# [SERVE_UPDATE_POLITE] (UPDATE_MAX_WAIT 100 s): with the clients on, t2
# waits; 40 s in both are told "The server updates to t2 in 60 s" and
# floorplanner's Starport listing says updating; the restart comes 60 s
# after that, and the listing stops saying it. t4 waits while a client is
# on and goes once it leaves.
# Not checked: a real release archive (each version's own cache: here the
# checks' cache is shared, so t2's floorplanner is changed to make its
# compile real).
