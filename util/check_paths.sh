# <log>, and waits until <log> matches <ready-regex> (grep -E). Sets
# SERVER_PID (the server itself, not a pipe's end) and SERVER_PORT.
# **The port is checked first**: one already listened on (a desk server
# on 29500, another check) fails at once, naming it -- before, the check
# waited out its timeout as "did not come up", or talked to the other
# server. "auto" picks a free one in 29700-29999. A server that exits
# while waited for fails at once too. Returns 1 when the server did not
# come up, 2 when the port is taken, with the reason (and the log's tail)
# on stderr; the caller says FAIL. A check with a verdict of its own on a
# server that did not come up (a SKIP) keeps it, and still fails on a
# taken port:

# verdict_keep has to be the very next line after the command that made
