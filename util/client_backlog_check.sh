# [CHUNK_RELOAD]: the client reads its socket dry into a 64 MB read-ahead,
# so the server saw an empty queue while the client was minutes behind, and
# replicate's hold-back never engaged: a view range stepped up and down sent
# every chunk's create and remove, played back for minutes after. The client
# now says what it has read and not handled (network:backlog), and
# pending_bytes() counts it.
#
# A client that handles one packet a frame (BUILDAT_PACKET_DRAIN_US) joins a
# minimal world; replicate must hold it back ("peer N held").
