# [INSTALLED_RECENT]: a game or an app just installed is first on the
# launcher's recent list. Four launcher starts on one user path:
#   1. a game and an app already there (an upgraded client): all seen,
#      nothing noted in the launch history;
#   2. a game added: noted;
#   3. an app added: noted, and first on "Continue" (a screenshot kept);
#   4. a new version of that app: not new, the history unchanged.
