# [ACCOUNT_CREATE]: making an account is its own action, not a side effect of
# a mistyped name at login. This drives the server end of it over a real
# network:
#   1. a plain login (create=0) of a name that does not exist is refused as
#      unknown -- the server does not make the account;
#   2. a create login (create=1) of a new name makes the account and joins;
#   3. a plain login of that name and password then joins.
# A server the launcher did not start is public ([VANILLA_PUBLIC]) and asks
# everyone to log in; loopback is non-local on it. Its registration is closed,
# so the first (admin) account needs the setup code from the server's log.
#
# The two-password-match of the Create window is client-only Lua (pw ~= pw2)
# and is not driven here; the scripted login carries one password.
