# item -- is drawn from where the client has the player now, so in third
# person it stays at the hand as the player turns and walks, where the
# server's place for it trailed. VoxeLibre in third person with a stone in
# hand: turned to four yaws, scanned right after each turn and after it
# settles, then walking; every scan has the item at the same place in the
# model's own frame.
