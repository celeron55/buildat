#   1. <user>/apps/aitta/save_now written: gone within seconds, the log
#      saying saving and saved.
#   2. The user directory copied with cp -a while it runs, a second
#      server started on the copy: the admin account came along (no setup
#      code), and its health token is the first one's.
