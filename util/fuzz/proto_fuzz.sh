# [SECURITY_RUN_1] phase 4, protocol fuzzing: a vanilla server on a scratch
# user directory with a devtest world running (as the tests start one,
# launcher=1, so the fuzzer is the local peer and every launcher-only door
# is open to it), proto_fuzz.py at it, and the server watched: still
# running, still answering a connect, and its log free of a crash. The
# log and the seed go to local/security/fuzz/proto/.
#
# PUBLIC=1 starts it as a public server (no -u): the fuzzer is then any
# peer on the internet, with no door of the launcher's open. BUILD=asan
# runs Build/asan's server (cmake -DSANITIZE=address there), whose
# runtime-compiled modules are instrumented too. APP=floorplanner runs that
# app instead, and the fuzzer logs in, opens a plan and sends batches and
# plan files built from its schema (proto_fuzz.py). GAME=mineclone2 runs
# vanilla's world on that game (VoxeLibre) instead of devtest.
