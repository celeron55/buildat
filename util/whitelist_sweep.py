# What Urho3D exposes to Lua, against what client/extensions/urho3d/safe_classes.lua
# lets a server's Lua reach. Prints the classes that are neither wrapped nor
# refused, per subsystem, so that a whitelist sweep has a finish line and the
# next one starts where the last stopped.
#
# See [URHO_SWEEP] and [WHITELIST_POLICY] in doc/plan/master_plan.md: the
# whitelist is a list of what has been looked at, and a class looked at and
# rejected is worth a line saying so, or the next sweep looks at it again.

# Usage: util/whitelist_sweep.py [subsystem ...]
