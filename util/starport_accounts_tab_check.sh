# [STARPORT_ACCOUNTS_TAB]: the Starport app's Accounts tab (the accounts
# module's page, opened through its own window) must open every time, from
# every tab. It used to open only once: a Starport-native page's open()
# removed the view element out from under the accounts module, whose M.page
# then pointed at a removed element; the next open of Accounts aborted in
# accounts' close_page ("UIElement was removed"), so the tab's button lit up
# but the view stayed the other tab's.
#
# The drive, as the Starport's admin: Accounts, Overview, Accounts. The same
# page drawn twice in one run is byte-identical, so acc1 == acc2 (Accounts
# both times) and != ov (Overview); and the abort's error must not appear.
