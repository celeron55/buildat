# tier: full
# cost: ~180s (2026-10-04)
# covers: builtin/accounts/accounts.cpp on_login's non-local wiring and is_local
# [SECURITY_RUN_2]: the login rate limit end-to-end over a real network, the
# residual that accounts.cpp's rate_limit_self_check() leaves (the self-check
# drives note_failure/failure_wait with its own clock; this drives on_login
# itself through a client). A server the launcher did not start is public
# ([VANILLA_PUBLIC]) and loopback is non-local on it, so is_local is false and
# the password is checked.
#   1. a wrong password is refused as "Wrong password" (the fail() path) and
#      the server counts it (note_failure);
#   2. the accumulated failures lock the address's /24 ("Too many failed
#      logins"), the login rate limit working end-to-end.
#   3. on the launcher's server (floorplanner) started with an owner token, a
#      loopback client without the token is not local: a new account needs
#      the setup code ("no admin yet"), and nobody is made the owner;
#   4. the other counted fail() paths of a new account: a wrong setup code,
#      and an invite code that does not exist;
#   5. the same server without a token takes the loopback client as local
#      (no password, no code): the contrast that gives 3 its teeth;
#   6. a kept login logs in by its token, and an admin's password reset
#      ends it ("The saved login has ended");
#   7. with TOTP on (the secret put in the store), a wrong code is refused
#      and counted, and the right one joins.
# That a correct password is refused while the wait is non-zero (on_login
# checks the wait before the password) is covered by accounts.cpp's
# rate_limit_self_check(); it is not driven here because catching a client
# inside a short wait window across process starts is not deterministic.
