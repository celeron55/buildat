# [VERSION_CHECK]: Starport's version adapter for GitHub releases, the one
# the official instance uses. Copy it to <user>/apps/starport/version_adapter
# (executable); Starport runs it at the start and hourly and carries what it
# prints in /api/list. It prints the newest release by its tag's number --
# the releases are listed, as GitHub's "latest" skips prereleases, and the
# older ones are prereleases:
#   {"version": "0.6.90", "url": <its page>,
#    "platforms": {"linux": {"url": ...}, "win64": {"url": ...}}}
# A platform's url is its archive (the Windows installer when there is
# one). GITHUB_REPO names another repository (owner/name).
