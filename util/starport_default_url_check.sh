# [STARPORT_DEFAULT_URL]: a fresh Hearth whose IDs stay off announces
# nothing; its admin turning IDs on ("anyone", with the https address the
# admin reached it by, as the users page sends it) announces it, unlisted,
# to the default Starport (BUILDAT_STARPORT_DEFAULT: a local one here) at
# that address, with no name, kind or audience set and the listing never
# claimed; it is verified over TLS, is not in the list, and an ID joins.
# An announce naming its address from elsewhere gets no ID token. Starport
# turned off in starport.json reads as IDs off, and IDs turned on again turn
# it on; a joined admin is told each time.
