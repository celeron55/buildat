# [CLOSE_GLYPH]: launch_menu at a phone's size in the touch mode
# (BUILDAT_TOUCH=1, 400x760), and at a desktop's:
#   1. Home, the first screen, has no ×.
#   2. Apps has one, inside its window's top right corner (ui scan).
#   3. A tap on it closes Apps as Escape does: Home is back.
#   4. Starport settings (open_window) has one too, and a click on it
#      closes it.
# Screenshots in $t (KEEP_TMP=1 keeps it).
