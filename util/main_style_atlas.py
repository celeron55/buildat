# [MENU_BRAND]: draws extensions/launch_menu/res/main_style.png in c_quiet
# (src/interface/web_brand.h) over the cells of the old grey atlas.
# Cells main_style.xml names get their own fill and border; the rest (arrows,
# toolbar, cursors) keep their shapes, their greys tinted toward the brand's.
# Run from the repository root; it rewrites the PNG in place.
