# [AITTA_REVIEW]: a local Aitta with an admin (a reviewer) and a plain
# account; tester/pt (apps/minigame) published as 1.0.0, 1.0.1 (a file
# changed, one added) and 1.0.2.
#   1. The admin marks 1.0.0 reviewed and delists 1.0.2; 1.0.1's diff is
#      against 1.0.0. A ticket fetches the delisted 1.0.2 once, not twice,
#      and nothing without one; the plain account gets no ticket.
#   2. The admin's client, joined from the launcher: Review releases, 1.0.1's
#      page, Playtest; the launcher's dialog, its yes; installed under
#      <user>/review and launched.
#   3. The launcher again: the playtest's tile and its Remove; Aitta's page
#      with 1.0.0 reviewed and 1.0.1 unreviewed.
#   4. A client under a managed lock: Aitta's page with 1.0.0 only.
# Screenshots in $t (KEEP_TMP=1 keeps it).
