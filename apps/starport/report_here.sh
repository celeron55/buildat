# [REPORT_HERE]: "Report this server..." finds the listing of the server
# a native client is on. A local Starport, a floorplanner listed and
# claimed on it, and a player's client with only that Starport, which
# opens the report from the plan picker's menu by the keyboard. Each run is
# one combination of the public address in starport.json (with the port,
# without it, none) and the address the client joined by (with the port,
# without it); and one where the listing is under another name for the
# same host, which must offer the listing to pick.
#
# An address without the port means 29500, so those runs need the
# server there; with 29500 taken (a server of the desk's) the server is on
# 29643 and they are skipped, said as such.
