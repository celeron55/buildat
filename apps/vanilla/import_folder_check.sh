# [LUANTI_IMPORT_FOLDER]: the Luanti imports read <user>/shared/vanilla/
# import, with the local server sandboxed as it is by default. In it: a
# game (minetest_game, a game.conf alone) and three worlds -- "oldmtg"
# made as gameid = minetest, "other" wanting a game nobody has, "bare"
# with no gameid.
#   1. "Import a Luanti game" lists minetest_game; a click selects it
#      (the panel says where it was found), Import copies it in.
#   2. "Import a Luanti world" lists oldmtg as minetest_game's (installed
#      now), other as needing its game, and says one world was left out;
#      selecting oldmtg and Import makes a save of it.
#   3. The "Open the import folder" button is there (not pressed: it
#      would open a file manager on the desk).
# Screenshots in $t (KEEP_TMP=1 keeps it).
