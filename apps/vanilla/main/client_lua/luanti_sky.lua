-- The sky, drawn by Luanti's own shader rather than buildat's.
--
-- `extensions/luanti_client/res/LuantiSky.glsl` is the sky the other Luanti
-- client draws, and this is the second consumer of it -- the same
-- arrangement the world's shaders are already in, one set shared by both
-- clients with `builtin/voxel_shading` left to the nine games that want
-- buildat's look. See [SHADER_HOME] in doc/plan/master_plan.md.
--
-- **What this is not** is a new sky. The launcher works out what colour the
-- sky is at this hour, how far the sun has got and how many stars are out,
-- and goes on doing exactly that; this only takes those answers to a
-- different shader, whose parameters have different names and one different
-- shape. Where the two disagree is written down at each call.
--
-- **Every uniform is set here at creation**, including the ones nothing ever
-- changes: a shader parameter a material never sets reads as zero, and zero
-- for most of these is a black sky.
