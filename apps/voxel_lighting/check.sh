# apps/voxel_lighting: **the look check, run rather than eyeballed**
# ([LOOK_CHECK], the rule the user calls not negotiable: a game's look is
# not allowed to change, and a change under builtin/voxel_shading or the
# mesher is checked against this game's views). The views themselves are
# `check.txt`, which a person has been driving by hand -- so "a change
# passes it by not being run" ([CHECK_BASELINE]).
#
#   apps/voxel_lighting/check.sh            # against the kept reference
#   apps/voxel_lighting/check.sh --accept   # this run becomes it
#
# **What it compares**: the fourteen framings of check.txt, each against
# the same framing of the reference run in local/voxel_lighting/ref/, by
# RMSE. The numbers are printed whatever the verdict, because the size
# of a difference is the reading.
#
# **The scene is not quite the same twice.** The sky-visibility sweep is
# snapped at each camera but its rays are not the same rays, so the
# terrain views move a few levels between two runs of one tree while the
# canopy and sky views come back identical -- and the variation is not
# stationary: two runs back to back differed by 0 to 5 here and a third
# differed from the first by up to 19 (measured 2026-09-25). So
# `--accept` shoots the scene twice and keeps each view's difference
# beside the reference as a reading, and **the bar is thirty** -- the
# separation [CHECK_BASELINE] measured, against real changes of 72 to
# 868.
#
# **What it therefore catches**, measured by breaking the shader on
# purpose (2026-09-25): the ambient term replaced by a flat red is 64 on
# the worst view and fails; the bounced-light term multiplied by 1.5 is
# 14 and passes, that term being a small part of what a lit surface
# ends up at. So this catches a change of the kind [LOOK_CHECK] is
# about -- the speckle, the flood, the ambient -- and not a small
# adjustment to a small term. The noise printed beside each view is
# what says where the check is blunt.
#
# **The reference is a run, not a committed picture** (user,
# 2026-09-19): no image set in git. Until a BASELINE commit is picked,
# the reference is the last run somebody accepted on this machine, and a
# tree with no reference yet says so rather than passing.
