#   1. trust: c, in the admin's group, edits on three days and is trusted
#      on the third; b, in a's group of untrusted admins, edits on the
#      same days and is not; with untrusted a made an admin of the admin's
#      group, a vouch there is refused, and with a no longer one it goes;
#   2. invites: 20 waiting a group, and the 21st refused; 50 an inviter a
#      day, and the 51st refused until the next day; after a decline none
#      from that group for 7 days; after "no invites from this group"
#      none at all;
#   3. counts: 10 groups made an account, and the 11th refused; 50 plans
#      an account (49 copied on disk), and the 51st refused;
#   4. the budget at 0: an untrusted account makes no plan, a trusted one
#      does;
#   5. k deleted: k's plan goes, k's group goes to c (trusted) before m1
#      (in it longer), and k's group with nobody else in it is deleted.
