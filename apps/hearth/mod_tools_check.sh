# [HEARTH_MOD_TOOLS]: on a local Hearth, a moderator (mia), a helper (hal),
# a member (mem) and a new account (neo) with an image in thread 1.
#   1. The message's action row ("hearth: action" lines): the member sees
#      no tool; the helper "Show images to everyone", which shows them and
#      turns to "Hide images from everyone"; the moderator Delete... and
#      Ban... on a member's or a new account's message; a helper's has
#      Delete... only.
#   2. The moderator's Delete... (the dialog driven): the message's place
#      says "Deleted by", the author is told, appeals, and the appeal
#      restores it; Delete of a thread's first message hides the thread.
#   3. Ban... for a day (the dialog driven): neo's join is refused with the
#      reason and the end; a day on (the server's sim clock) let in. A
#      helper is not banned, and a member deletes and bans nothing.
# Screenshots of the row and the two dialogs in $t (KEEP_TMP=1 keeps it).
