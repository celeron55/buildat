# [HEARTH_THANKS]: bob, a member, starts a thread. carol, a new account, is
# refused a thanks, and so is bob on his own message. The admin thanks it,
# takes it back and gives it again; dave and erin thank it too. bob has one
# notification for the three, erin's name and "2" others in it; once he has
# looked, frank's thanks is a new one. The message carries 4 and the
# admin's "thanked", and its page shows "+4".
