# [HEARTH_USABILITY] 1, **phone**: the same post as desktop_mouse.sh, from
# the web client in headless Chrome as a phone (390x844 at 3 device pixels,
# touch), held upright and then turned (844x390). Each time by taps: log in,
# Help, New thread..., a title and a message, File... (the browser's picker,
# given the shot), a finger's drag to the page's end (the field has grown
# with the link, [HEARTH_PAGE_SCROLL]) and Start the thread. The two threads carry the uploaded
# image's link and draw its thumbnail ([HEARTH_ATTACHMENTS]), and the image
# is served. What a phone does and Chrome here does not (the on-screen
# keyboard over the page, the real picker) is for a test by hand. Needs
# web/ from util/build_web.sh.
