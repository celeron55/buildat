# [HEARTH_RESUME_2]: a client with BUILDAT_HEARTH_RESUME=1 opens a topic's
# new-thread page, types a title and a two-line message and quits; started
# again, it is on that page with both fields back.
# simplified: native only; the kept state is client Lua, the same on the
# web, whose storage ([HEARTH_RESUME]) is the one difference left undriven.
# There is no new-thread page without a topic to keep.
# [SERVER_VERSION]: the first client's Server window shows the server's
# Buildat and the client's, the same build here.
